## Current problems/optimization points
- [ ] When the desktop version submits multiple pictures in one message, if you choose not to compress the picture, it will be sent by Telegram in turn, resulting in the submission being split into multiple messages (there is no problem with compressed pictures, and there is no good solution for the time being)
